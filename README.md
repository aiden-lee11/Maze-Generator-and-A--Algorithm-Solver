# Maze-Generator-and-A--Algorithm-Solver
This was my first attempt at a backtracking algorithm in python as well as my first project that involved classes. 
The basic premise of the project is that the maze.py file creates a new randomized maze based off of a given grid, 
then that grid is subsequently fed into the astar.py file which uses the A* maze solving algorithm to complete the maze
and highlight the best solution in purple.
